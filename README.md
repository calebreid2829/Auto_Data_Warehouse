# Description
 Automatically set up a data warehouse from a single source file or dataframe
 [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/xrHaXRYy/staging)
# Overview
- Creates dimension and fact tables from the initial file/dataframe
- They are then saved to the warehouse folder for now, but will likely set it up to store to the HDFS with Hive instead
- Created to assist me with quickly creating datasets to train neural networks instead of formatting it all by hand
